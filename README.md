# Export Tabs URLs

[Export Tabs URLs Phoenix](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-phoenix/) is a Web browser extension that allows to list the URLs of all the open tabs and export/copy that list to clipboard, text file, or html bookmarks file.

https://github.com/clach04/export-tabs-urls-phoenix is a fork of [alct's (Andre Loconte) export-tabs-urls](https://github.com/alct/export-tabs-urls) (version 0.2.12 from 2019).

Renamed and newer version number(s) to attempt to reduce confusion with the original upstream.

To install:

  * Firefox open https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-phoenix/
      * For Firefox versions earlier than version 109 install the Legacy (v2 manifest) release from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-phoenix-legac/

Original readme below from https://github.com/alct/export-tabs-urls

----------------------------------------------------

[Export Tabs URLs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/export-tabs-urls-and-titles/) (ETU) is a Web browser extension that allows to list the URLs of all the open tabs and copy that list to clipboard or export it to a timestamped file.

Consider this add-on done (except for bugfixes). I may or may not add new features depending on the fun (or lack of it).

## Features

- **Include titles** : ETU provides a default format which displays titles along tabs URLs ;
- **Custom format** : optionally, custom patterns can be defined instead of the default "include titles" one (e.g. markdown) ;
- **Filter tabs** : ETU provides a RegExp-enabled tabs filter ;
- **Limit to current window** : optionally, the list can be limited to the current window ;
- **List non-HTTP(s) URLs** : optionally, ETU can list each and every tab, including cases where the URL scheme isn't HTTP(s)

## Permissions

- **Access browser tabs** : required to list the tabs ;
- **Input data to the clipboard** : required to copy the list to the clipboard ;
- **Display notifications** : not strictly required/needed (as the extension could work without it) but it is used to improve the user experience by providing visual feedback about what is going on (if the "Enable Notifications" option is selected) ;
- **Storage** : required to store settings.
